        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>I currently work at Hawaiian Airlines in the Information Technology department.  Formerly, I graduated from the University of Hawaii at Manoa with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.  My goal is to obtain a challenging web developer position in a dynamic and innovative organization where I can utilize my technical and creative skills to develop and maintain responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing websites.</p>

          <h3>Online Ordering Website</h3>
          <p>Current solo project utilizing React JS and Node.js to create this website and I use GitHub to store my code.  I implemented Supabase as my database.  Along with default page tabs, I also created a secure admin page for authorized users to make changes in the database "remotely". The online ordering and menu page pulls directly from my database to map out the available drinks.  I used the useState hooks in React to store the cart items in the session.  For the payment portal, I integrated Square since that is the POS system the shop will use for in-person orders. </p>

          <h3>Proccess Improvements w/ Power Automate</h3>
          <p>Implemented an automated process using Power Automate flows triggered by Microsoft Forms or PowerApps.  Our help desk sign-in sheet is automated to make an incident ticket in Service Now once a user submits a form from PowerApps and then triggers an HTTP request.  I have also automated our training tracker system where my manager sees how many training plans we have completed.  I used Power Automate to automate our hardware asset subtraction when someone removes items from our JIT.  </p>

            <h3>InternBit Website Scraper</h3>
            <p>InternBit was a UH-funded research program for software developers that aimed to help ICS students in college find internships via a recommendation system.  Tools used in this project were React JS, Node.js, X-Ray, Pupeteer, Tatooine, NightMare, Figma, and GitHub.  We used website scrapers to collect internship opportunities from all the technology websites we could find in 2020.  Our goal was to bring all tech job listings to one place, which would allow you to use filters to find your internship.</p>

            <h3>C++ Address Book</h3>
            <p>I made an address book for a class project in ICS 212 - Program Structure.  This project uses C/C++ language and I created it in PuTty Linux.  Its functions include adding a new record, finding an existing record, deleting an existing record, reading each record via text file and storing it into an array, reading each record and storing it into a text file, and a cleanup to free all space on the heap.  Please have a look at my code in the links below.</p>

            <h3>LinkUp Manoa Web Application</h3>
            <p>For our group project, we created a web application for UH students to receive help with their courses.  This web app mimicked a tutoring system where students could help out other students in a face-to-face environment.  In large colleges, the teacher-to-student ratio is never favorable, which inspired us to create this idea.  You could create study groups, schedule study sessions, and create friendships.    </p>

            <h3>Video Game Design</h3>
            <p>For the final project of our class, we were to create a video game with our group.  We used C# and Bolt in Unity to create the game.  My role was to implement enemies into the scenes, create the boss level, and health bar, and make pieces collectible by the player.  Please see the websites below for more information.</p>
